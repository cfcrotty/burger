Eat-Da-Burger! Homework

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This application is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) deployed in Heroku. It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### How to Use:

1. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. I am using Node.js with Express, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS that is deployed in Heroku.
